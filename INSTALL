Requirements
------------
- perl 5
- postgresql 6.5 or later (I'm using 7.0)
- DBD::Pg  (postgresql DBI modules)
- File::stat;


Installation Instructions
-------------------------
1) create a user called wwwindex in your postgres database
    o  createuser --createdb -no-adduser -P
    o  then type in wwwindex and its password

2) create a database called wwwindex
    o  createdb -U wwwindex wwwindex

3) create a database table called files:
    o  psql -U wwwindex wwwindex
    o  create table files (
           name VARCHAR(512),
           hits INTEGER NOT NULL,
           description VARCHAR(256)
         );

4) copy index.cgi to somewhere with +ExecCGI permissions.
   For example your cgi-bin directory:
         cp index.cgi /home/httpd/cgi-bin

5) Give it execute permissions:
        chmod 755 /home/httpd/cgi-bin/index.cgi

6) Edit the top part of index.cgi and wwwdesc.pl to give it the runtime
   parameters.  You may also need to edit the first line to give it your
   path to perl's executable which can be found by running:
          which perl

7) Link to it in each directory you want to use it.
         ln -s /home/httpd/cgi-bin/index.cgi .

Thats it, it will now create indexes of that directory.

If you want to update the descriptions of files in a directory, just go to 
that directory and run wwwdesc.pl.  It will ask you for your password and 
then a description of each file inside.

Additionaly, if you create a .welcome.html file in a directory with 
index.cgi it will display that just after the header.

<center><h1>WWWIndex</h1></center>

This program (which you can see its output below can generate a directory index
of your files in the current directory.  It can also calculate hits, and 
display a description of those files.<br>
WWWIndex has a database backend to keep track of your files' descriptions and hits.  Currently, only postgresql is supported, but if enough people are using this and the demand is there, I would be willing to make it run on MySQL.  From what I can tell, postgresql is better and that's why I chose it.<br>

<p><b>Installation</b><br>
WWWindex is extremely easy to use, and I think it is the easiest application to install that uses a database backend.  I of course could be biased...  You can read the <a href="INSTALL">INSTALL</a> file which comes with the tarball.
